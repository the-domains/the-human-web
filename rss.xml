            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Programmable blockchains in context: Ethereum's Future</h1><p>Spanish version By the end of this article, you're going to understand blockchains in general (and Ethereum, a next-generation blockchain platform, in particular) well enough to decide what they mean to your life. Ethereum brings up strong emotions. Some have compared it to SkyNet, the distributed artificial intelligence of the Terminator movies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/32bb104c9f2e515174cb9b5370e252885df954d6.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Indoor Positioning System Tracks Your Phone Using Sound Waves</h1><p>As impressive as GPS and other radio signal-based positioning technologies are, they pretty much all crap out once the device-to-be-localised is inside. This is just a fundamental property of radio waves-put something solid enough, such as most building materials, in front of them and they will attenuate.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/50ed43c71271b434e7d7107e1a1df8bc0f3d1184.jpg"></article>]]></description>

description: "NEC has announced that it is developing earbuds that can confirm an owner's identity. The Japanese firm says the technology works by playing a sound and then checking how it resonates in the wearer's ear canal. This provides a biometric check that serves as an alternative to a fingerprint sensor or eye scanner."

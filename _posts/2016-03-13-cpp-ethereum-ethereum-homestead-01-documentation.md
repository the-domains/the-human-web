description: 'Many of the original C++ developers moved on to roles at Slock.it and Ethcore in late 2015 and early 2016 following a 75% cut in funding for C++ development. Those cuts were part of a broader effort to bring Foundation costs under control, and they happened prior to the recent spike in ETH value which has put the Foundation in a much more comfortable financial position.'

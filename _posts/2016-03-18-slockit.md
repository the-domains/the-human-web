description: "Standardization through Abstraction Today's IoT is fragmented and heterogeneous, with each manufacturer attempting to impose their own standards. Because each additional Ethereum Computer deployed benefits the DAO participants collectively (in the form of incremental revenue), the DAO model encourages our community to leverage and promote a common, interoperable network, regardless of manufacturer."

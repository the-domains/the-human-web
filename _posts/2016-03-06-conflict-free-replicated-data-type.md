description: 'In distributed computing, a conflict-free replicated data type (abbreviated CRDT) is a type of specially-designed data structure used to achieve strong eventual consistency (SEC) and monotonicity (absence of rollbacks). There are two alternative routes to ensuring SEC: operation-based CRDTs and state-based CRDTs.'
